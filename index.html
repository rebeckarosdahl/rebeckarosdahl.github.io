      <h1> Featured Project </h1>
      <h2> Inq - Digital queing </h2>
      <p> Mobile aplication for iOS created with Node.js and React Native.
      The idea was to create a mobile application which can be used as a digital
      queue-machine whenever a queuing system is needed.
      The customer is able to do other things while waiting
      for their turn in the digital queue. The app estimates the time left before the customer gets their help.

      <h1> Featured Project </h1>
      <h2> Hack.a.thon Brännbollsyran </h2>
      <p> Winner of Brännbollsyran Hackathon 2019! <br>
        My team and I created a mobile application using Firebase and React Native.
        Our winning proposal included a solution to the issue of people leaving
        the festival between acts. The application is a democratic dancefloor,
        where the users interact and vote to decide which song will be played next.
        This turns the space in front of the empty stage into a large dance floor.
        The solution was implemented in "Brännbollsyran" application and released in March 2020. <br><br><br>

            <h1>Project Info</h1>
            <p>This project was a collaboration with the company Fältgruppen,
              a social care unit in Umeå Municipality.
              The aim with the AR-application Todo was to help Fältgruppen in
              their prevention work among youth and minors. By using this application
              the users get to know where things are happening in the city.
              This could be anything from small events like art lessons to concerts.
              <br><br>
              The application was created in Unity as an assignment in the
              advanced course "Interactivity in Smart Environments". I created
              the map in Unity and animated the different obejcts in C#. </p>

              <h1>Methods</h1>
              <p> Numerous methods and software were used during the project. Among the most
                important were: Unity, UX, UI and C#. Created
                during October and December 2018. </p>

            <h1>Project Info</h1>
            <p>This project aimed to improve a current product used in extreme sports.
              Based on my interest for offpist skiing, I decided to redesign an avalanche transciever.
              Today, transcievers are designed to be placed underneath the jacket.
              My idea was to innovate it by improving user experience and
              providing a user friendly connection to the product. This was done by
              designing it as a wristwatch.
              <br><br>
              Research and testing of the design were made before creating the final
              prototype in Rhino, a 3D-rendering program. This project was part of the
              course "3D-design" at Umeå School of Design autumn 2019. </p>

              <h1>Methods</h1>
              <p> The transciever was created in Rhino, and renderd
              in Keyshot. The UX-design elements were designed using Illustrator.</p>

            <h1>Project Info</h1>
            <p>This web application was created together with the company Sigma.
              Their HR department needed a solution that could help
              them to match a Sigma co:worker with a suitable work task
              available in their database.
              <br><br>
              The application was tested and designed in three iterations. In
              this project I was responsible for the user-testing and the
              front-end design.</p>

              <h1>Methods</h1>
              <p> Different methods were used during the project. The
                application was designed and tested in Lo-Fi prototypes,
                created in Figma, a prototype program. The web application was
                implemented in the end of the project using Big data from Sigma's
                database. Created with: SQL, C#, HTML and CSS. This project was
                created during the spring semester 2019.</p>

            <p>During two semesters, I was part of the project group for the
              Pepp organization. Pepp helps inspire young girls to continue
              studying for engineering degrees after high school. It was a
              rewarding position where I got the opportunity to be creative.
              <br><br>
              I was responsible for public relations and marketing in the project group.
              Therefore I did the graphic material such as posters and
              material for their social media.</p>
